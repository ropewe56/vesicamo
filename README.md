**Very SImple ClimAte MOdels**

This small collection of Jupyter notebooks is meant to clarify some of the physics that is relevant for climate science.

1. **green_house_effect.ipynb**

This is a very simple model of the green houese effect. It shows the influence of an absorbing layer in the ahomspeher on earth surface temperature.

2. **mean_earth_surface_temp.ipynb**

In simplified climate models often raiation from the earth surface is appriximated by assuming a mean surface temperature and applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law. The radiation density is proportional to $T^4$. What is the value of the mean surface temperature if the surface is split into to parts wih two different temperatures but with the same overall heat raiation power.   

## A Remark 

I'm physicist but also a human. Humans tend to make errors. If anybody finds an error I would be very appreciative for this information. But please keep in mind that the models are intentionally simple to catch the underlying physics not to explain in detail the earth's climate. 

There is another Gilab repository ropewe56/simpleco2. This is a simple model of the radiation transfer in the atmosphere where radition is only absorbed and emitted by $CO_2$. The model itself is complete bty the documentaion is stil work in progress.
